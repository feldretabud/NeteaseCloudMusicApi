Phenomenology of Spirit is a philosophical work by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel that was published in 1807. It is considered one of the most influential and difficult texts in Western philosophy. It explores the development of human consciousness and its relation to history, society, religion, art, science, and morality. Hegel uses the term "spirit" (Geist) to refer to the collective and dynamic aspect of human reality that transcends individuality and rationality. He also uses the term "phenomenology" to describe the method of studying how spirit manifests itself in different forms and stages of development. The text consists of an introduction and six main parts: Consciousness, Self-Consciousness, Reason, Spirit, Religion, and Absolute Knowing.
