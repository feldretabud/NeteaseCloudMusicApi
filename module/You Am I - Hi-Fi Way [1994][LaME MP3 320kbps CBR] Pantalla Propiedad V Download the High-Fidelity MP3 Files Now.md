You Am I is an Australian rock band that formed in 1989 and has released eleven studio albums so far. Their second album, Hi Fi Way, was released in 1995 and is widely regarded as one of the best and most influential Australian albums of the 1990s. Produced by Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, Hi Fi Way showcases the band's distinctive blend of alternative rock, power pop and indie rock, with catchy melodies, clever lyrics and diverse influences.

The album reached #1 on the local albums chart and received critical acclaim from both Australian and international media. In 2008, it was voted the sixth greatest Australian album of all time in The Age newspaper's 50 Greatest Aussie Albums poll.

The album includes the singles "Cathy's Clown", "Jewels and Bullets" and "Purple Sneakers", which are among the band's most popular and enduring songs. The album also features some of the band's most experimental and adventurous tracks, such as "The Applecross Wing Commander", "Punkarella" and "Ken (The Mother Nature's Son)". The album's title track, "Hi Fi Way", is a nostalgic ode to music and family, with references to The Beatles, The Kinks and The Who.
 
Hi Fi Way is a classic example of You Am I's unique style and sound, which has influenced many other Australian bands and artists over the years. The album is a must-listen for any fan of Australian rock music or anyone who appreciates well-crafted songs with personality and charm.

In 2013, You Am I reissued remastered versions of Hi Fi Way, along with their other albums Sound as Ever and Hourly, Daily, with bonus discs featuring B-sides, out-takes and live recordings. The band also toured major cities of Australia on the Hi Fi Daily Double Tour, performing both Hourly, Daily and Hi Fi Way in their entirety, followed by an encore of other songs from these reissued collections. The tour was a huge success and a testament to the enduring appeal of these albums. Vinyl versions of the three albums were released for the first time to coincide with this tour.
 
In 2014, a live recording from the 2013 tour was released as a vinyl/DVD box set titled Live Electrified, featuring performances of Hi Fi Way and Hourly, Daily at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. The box set also included a documentary film about the making of Hi Fi Way, featuring interviews with the band members, producer Lee Ranaldo and other collaborators. The film revealed some of the challenges and joys of creating such a landmark album in a short time and under difficult circumstances.
 
Hi Fi Way remains a classic Australian rock album that has influenced generations of musicians and fans. It is an album that captures the spirit and energy of You Am I, a band that has never stopped evolving and experimenting. It is an album that deserves to be celebrated and rediscovered by new audiences.
