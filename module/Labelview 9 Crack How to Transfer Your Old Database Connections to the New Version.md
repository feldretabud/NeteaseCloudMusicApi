1. Download and install Labelview 9 from [TEKLYNX website](https://www.teklynx.com/en/products/label-design-solutions/labelview). You can choose between the Pro or Gold edition, depending on your needs. You can also try the software for free for 30 days.
2. Launch Labelview 9 and select File > New to create a new label. You can choose from a variety of predefined label templates or create your own custom label size.
3. Add a barcode object to your label by clicking on the Barcode tool in the toolbar. You can drag and resize the barcode object on the label as you wish. To change the barcode properties, double-click on the barcode object or right-click and select Properties. You can choose from over 100 barcode symbologies, such as Code 39, Code 128, EAN-13, QR Code, Data Matrix, and more. You can also enter or link the barcode data, adjust the barcode size and appearance, and apply various options such as check digits, human-readable text, or rotation.
4. Add other objects to your label, such as text, graphics, lines, boxes, or images. You can use the Text tool to add static or variable text fields, such as product name, price, date, or serial number. You can use the Graphic tool to add logos, symbols, or pictures from your computer or from Labelview's library of clipart. You can use the Line or Box tool to draw lines or boxes around your objects or to create borders. You can use the Image tool to insert images from your scanner or camera.
5. Connect your label to a database if you want to print labels with variable data from an external source. You can connect to Excel, Access, SQL, or other databases via OLE or ODBC connection. To connect your label to a database, select File > Database Connection Wizard and follow the steps to select your data source, table, and fields. You can then link your label objects to the database fields by using the Database Field tool or by selecting Properties > Data Source > Database Field.
6. Preview and print your label by selecting File > Print Preview or File > Print. You can choose your printer settings, such as printer name, driver, copies, range, orientation, and media type. You can also use the Print Preview window to view how your labels will look like before printing and to make any adjustments if needed.
